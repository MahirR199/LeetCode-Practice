Kind of like remove element but this time the 2 pointers will start either adjaecent or right on top of each other
if the element at the first pointer is equal to the element at 2nd pointer then increment the 2nd pointer
else increment the first pointer and make it equal to the value at the 2nd pointer then increment the 2nd pointer and increment k(unique number of elems)
make all of this under the condition the 2nd pointer is less than the length of the input list
make k = 1 from beginning and return 0 if list is empty
