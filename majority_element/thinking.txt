This problem requires O(n) time and O(1) Space. This requires an algorithm named 
Moore's Voting Algorithm. Mark the first element and have a count. Everytime you encounter the same element increase the count 
else decrease the count
if the count reaches 0, change the marked element to the current element and change the count back to 1
this problem guarantees a majority element appearing floor(n/2) but if it did not then we would
loop through the entire list again checking if the final marked element of the algorithm 
appeared floor(n/2) times.
